## Part1: What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.

For example:

```
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
```

In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.


## Part2: Find at which step all flashes are lid
This is a part of my solution already so the output is done with a simple if statement
